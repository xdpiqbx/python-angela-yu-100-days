# Bootstrap

- [How it works](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/grid/#how-it-works)
  - Our grid supports six responsive breakpoints.
  - Containers center and horizontally pad your content.
  - Rows are wrappers for columns.
  - Columns are incredibly flexible. (There are 12 template columns available per row)
  - Gutters are also responsive and customizable.
  - Sass variables, maps, and mixins power the grid.
